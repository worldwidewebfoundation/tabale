Testing the application

This directory contains a framework for testing the application.

What is tested: The tests makes request to the application's VoiceXML
files, just like a voice browser would.  It does so in a variety of
contexts (for instance, when the user exists in the database or
not), and with various parameters (callerId)

Errors are reported if:
       - there was an error fetching the voicexml file
       - the voicexml file is not valid voicexml 2.1 (as per the RelaxNG schema passed)

Errors that are not reported:
       - any runtime error during the execution of the fetched VoiceXML file by the voice browser.
       This would require having access to the browser's logs, and being able to simulate voice calls.

Usage:
        In a terminal, go to this directory and type run.sh
        Upon success the script eventually outputs: "Running tests....... Success!"
        Otherwise it prints details on the error.
